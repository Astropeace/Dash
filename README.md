## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or higher)
- NPM or Yarn
- Redis (for queuing and caching)
- PostgreSQL (as the main database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables (copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your configurations)
3. Install dependencies:

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

4. Run database migrations:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev
```

5. Start development servers:

```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend
npm run dev

# Start frontend server
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Architecture

This application consists of:

- **Backend**: Node.js/Express API server with Prisma ORM
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Redux Toolkit for state management, and MUI for UI components
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for main data storage
- **Caching**: Redis for performance optimization
- **Queue**: Bull for job processing (reporting, data sync, etc.)

## Deployment Steps

To make this application fully usable online:

1. **Database Setup**
   - Set up a production PostgreSQL database
   - Configure connection in `.env`
   - Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

2. **Backend Deployment**
   - Set up a VM or container (AWS EC2, Google Cloud, Heroku, etc.)
   - Configure environment variables for production
   - Set up Nginx or similar as a reverse proxy
   - Configure PM2 or similar for process management
   - Enable TLS/SSL for secure connections

3. **Frontend Deployment**
   - Build the frontend: `npm run build`
   - Deploy static assets to CDN or web server
   - Configure CORS for API access

4. **Authentication & Security**
   - Implement proper JWT token handling
   - Set up refresh token mechanism
   - Configure rate limiting
   - Enable CSRF protection
   - Perform security audit and penetration testing

5. **DevOps Setup**
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
   - Configure automated testing
   - Set up monitoring (New Relic, Datadog, etc.)
   - Configure logging and alerting

6. **Scaling Considerations**
   - Implement load balancing for backend services
   - Configure auto-scaling for handling traffic spikes
   - Optimize database queries and add indexing
   - Implement data partitioning for large datasets

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Enable GZIP compression
   - Optimize asset delivery
   - Implement caching strategies
   - Configure CDN for static assets

8. **User Onboarding**
   - Create documentation
   - Set up a support system
   - Implement user feedback mechanisms
   - Create tutorials or walkthroughs

9. **Legal & Compliance**
   - Add Privacy Policy
   - Add Terms of Service
   - Ensure GDPR compliance (if applicable)
   - Implement data retention policies

10. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
    - Set up uptime monitoring
    - Configure performance monitoring
    - Implement error tracking
    - Create backup and recovery strategy
